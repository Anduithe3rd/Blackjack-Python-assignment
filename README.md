# Blackjack-Python-assignment
This was an assignment to create a blackjack game in Python using Matplotlib to show the cards.

The rules are all the same as blackjack using simple buttons that let you hit or stand within a popup window.
The program, when run, will play a single game of blackjack.

As of version 1.0, it is pretty bare-bones
- The game UI is ugly
- It will sometimes start a new game immediately after the first one ends
- The lines describing the game and its outcome are only shown in the command line
- the code is messy and has little organization
  
The next version will attempt to fix all this
